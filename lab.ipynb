    "In this notebook you will work with [US flight delay data](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Tables.asp?DB_ID=120&DB_Name=Airline%20On-Time%20Performance%20Data&DB_Short_Name=On-Time) to develop a model that can forecast flight delays. You will create a regression model to forecast the number of minutes a given flight will be delayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw flight delay data is provided to you in an Amazon S3 bucket. The data you will use is a sample of the total flight data available in order to keep the runtimes reasonably short for a more fluid lab experience.\n",
    "You will find the flights data at: `https://clouda-labs-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sagemaker-notebooks/Flights.csv`\n"

    "- An S3 bucket has been provided for you to utilize\n",
    "- Some columns are not required and can be dropped to imporove training times.\n",
    "These include: `YEAR`, `TAIL_NUM`, `FL_NUM`, and `DEST`\n",
    "- Split data into training and test sets (60%/40% deterministic split)\n",
    "- Use the [linear-learner algorithm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/linear-learner.html) for training\n",
    "- Your objective is to produce a model that can predict the delay to within eight\n",
